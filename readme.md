## Get started

### Quick start demo

[A short video (less than 4 minutes)](https://youtu.be/dFHZosJPaLI) that goes over creating your first label and tracking your first package.

### Open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

You can deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux with Docker (recommended 4GB memory):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karrioapi/karrio/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

### Karrio Cloud

The simplest way to set up Karrio and take the front row in helping improve the platform is to request access to our managed deployment on [Karrio Cloud](https://www.karrio.io/get-started).

## The problem: Shipping integration is still painful

-   Lack of documentation.
-   Multiple and inconsistent APIs.
-   Difficult access to account and API credentials for development.
-   Poor developer experience.

## Our philosophy

We help you integrate with your shipping carriers and improve your fulfilment processes without loosing control.

We believe that the logistics industry can greatly benefit from a unified, open and standardized shipping API that gives you direct access to a network of carriers, control over customers' personal data and **compliance**.

## What are the benefits?

Karrio is the only **platform-focused** open-source shipping platform with label generation, document generation and package tracking API that **you can host on your own infrastructure**.

We are an open-source alternative to expensive in-house carrier integration and multi-carrier Saas APIs. We're designed to be more **developer-friendly**, with the fullset of shipping functionalities without vendor-lockin.

### Shipping for platforms

With Karrio, you can extend your platform with native shipping capabilities. Improve merchants and customers experience on your Marketplace, eCommerce, ERP, WMS, OMS, 3PL and Logistics platform.
With Karrio, 3PLs and large volume shippers regain control over their shipping tech stack and processes.

### Shipping for enterprise

Karrio makes modern shipping accessible to brands, retailers as well as businesses in regulated industries.
Ideal for pharmacy shipping where compliance is a must.
